Operators
---------

By now, you're probably familiar with the special :ref:`operators` that can be used with
structs. For instance, you can use the :code:`[]` operator to create arrays or the :code:`+`
operator to configure endianness. These operators allow you to customize and fine-tune
the behavior of your structs to fit your needs.
