In this section, we explore the core types used for representing data in binary
formats. *Caterpillar* provides a range of standard types to handle integers,
floating-point numbers, and special primitives. Whether you're dealing with
simple unsigned integers or more complex floating-point values, these types
are essential for defining the fields in your structs and ensuring accurate
data packing and unpacking.
