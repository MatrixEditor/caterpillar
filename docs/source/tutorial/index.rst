Tutorial to Caterpillar
***********************

*Caterpillar* stands out as a user-friendly and powerful Python framework, easy to learn and with robust
functionality. Providing an array of high-level data structures, it adopts a compact approach to represent
binary formats. Using Python's annotations and operator overloading feature, this library enables you to
write clean and structured code for handling binary formats.

Consider this tutorial as a stepping stone to explore the diverse options offered by *Caterpillar*. Upon
completion, you will be able to navigate standard struct and bitfield class definitions. Moreover, armed
with the insights gained here, you'll be well-equipped to create structures to your specific needs using
the library's rich feature set.

.. tip::
    Do not hastily skim through the library reference, as it explains the internal :ref:`datamodel` and
    introduces the supported :ref:`operators` applicable to structs, fields, and more.

For those ready to delve deeper or contribute to the framework, the :ref:`library-index` API documentation
is an important resource to start from.
