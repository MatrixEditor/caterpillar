Installation
************

*caterpillar* does not have a direct Python installation candidate. Therefore, you will need
to install it by providing the Git link. This library has no fixed dependencies, so it can run
out of the box.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/MatrixEditor/caterpillar.git


.. note::
    If you clone the repository, don't forget to add `-e` to the installation via pip as
    it enables developer mode.


If you wish to contribute to this project, make sure you follow the :ref:`contribution`. This
library is especially designed for Python 3.12 and prior versions are still subject to approval.
